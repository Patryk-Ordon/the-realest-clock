# the-realest-clock
This is a clock project designed around logic gates, binary counters and D flip-flops.

The project was created in the Multisim program and then physically executed.

The Arduino in the photos is only temporarily used to generate a clock signal for seconds and minutes, this will soon be corrected with appropriate dedicated electronics.
